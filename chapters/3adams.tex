\section{Adams' cobar construction}
In this chapter we define the cobar construction of a coalgebra and build up to Adams' remarkable 1956 theorem \cite{AdamsCobar}, which (roughly) says that given a based topological space $(X,x)$, one can recover the singular chains of the based loop space $\Omega_xX$ via a purely algebraic construction on the singular chains on $X$. We conclude by highlighting some recent refinements of Adams' theorem, which will be used in the proof of Looijenga's theorem.
