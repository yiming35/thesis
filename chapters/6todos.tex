\section{To do}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stallings' paper to two basepoints. Rewrite 'homology and the fundamental group' subsection. Complete proof of 4.16. Probably don't need 4.14 in proof of 4.16
    \item In def of two sided cobar maybe begin by normalizing everything?
    \item Present the alternative cochain normalization in \ref{prop:twoside_reduction}
    \item Notation/convention issues:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Spectral sequence indexing
        \item Twosided/one sided cobar notation
        \item Variants of AW and EZ
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
